<h1>Project 6: Sizing Tracks in CSS Grid</h1>
<p>This project is focused on using different sizes (%, px, etc.) to define width of the grid columns.</p>
<p>A large portion of this project is focused on the fractional size (fr).</p>
<p>Here's a list of covered fractional size topics:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The <em>fr</em> size can be used with other sizing methods like percentages or pixels</li>
    <li>A default height is needed to use <em>fr</em> sizes on grid-template-rows properly</li>
    <li><em>fr</em> sizes work by breaking up free space into fractional parts</li>
    <li>1fr 2fr; breaks down the free space into 3 parts with the 2fr taking up 2/3 of space while 1fr takes up 1/3</li>
</ul>
