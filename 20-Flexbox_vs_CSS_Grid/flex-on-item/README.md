<h1>Project 20: Flexbox vs CSS Grid - Flex on Item</h1>
<p>This part of the project is focused on creating a media player area. This media player area will have some basic buttons on the sides of a slider bar. This slider bar will show the progress of the song and can be used to change the song if fully coded in.</p>
<p>Remember, these are only templates that can be used to construct cool stuff in the future.</p>
<p>Will update once finished.</p>
