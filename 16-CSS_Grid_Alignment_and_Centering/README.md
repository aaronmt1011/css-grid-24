<h1>Project 16: CSS Grid Alignment and Centering</h1>
<p>This project has a "heftier" portion of new terms/properties to learn and define. For the most part, this project is focused on aligning the grid items along the x and y axis.</p>
<p>A <em>small</em> (I mean huge) difference between justiy- and align- is:</p>
<ul>
    <li>justify-* deals with x axis</li>
    <li>align-* deals with y axis</li>
</ul>
<p>The justiy- and align- properties will not change affected column/row, unlike <em>display: flex;</em> (can cause changes in affected column/row by changing the flow direction).</p>

<p>New spacing/positioning properties:</p>
<ul>
    <li>justify-items and align-items</li>
    <li>justify-content and align-content</li>
    <li>justify-self and align-self</li>
</ul>
