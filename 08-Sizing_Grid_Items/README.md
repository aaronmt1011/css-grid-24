<h1>Project 8: Sizing Grid Items</h1>
<p>The past projects have focused mainly on the grid container. This project will introduce working with grid items.</p>

<p>The first task to learn is to simply change the size of the grid itmes. This can be a bit challenging because sizing a grid item will affect the grid column/row it is in.</p>

<p>The answer to the above problem is... the <b>span</b> size!</p>

<p>Overview of span:</p>
<ul>
    <li><em>grid-column: span #;</em> is used to size a grid item's width-size by forcing the grid item to encompass the space of other grid items in the other columns (also forces the other grid items to go to next available space on the grid column)</li>
    <li><em>grid-row: span #;</em> is used to size a grid item's height size and works similar to above but only on the row instead of columns</li>
</ul>
