<h1>Project 13: Part 2 - Area Lines</h1>
<p>Part 2 of this project is focused on using grid area names to form our grids.</p>
<p>For this project, the grid will be made without defining the columns (using grid-template-columns).</p>
<p>A new tool called grid-row-end makes a brief cameo appearance.</p>
<p>Explanations should be in the "style.css" comments.</p>
