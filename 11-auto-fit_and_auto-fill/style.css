/*
auto-fill is used to give the browser the say on how to spread out the grid
items on the grid based off of conetent size and other factors into the 
columns.
*/

/*
auto-fill is useful because it can be resized based off the size fo the site.
If the site is larger, auto-fill will place more grid items with same space onto
the column until the grid width is the same as the site width. Works in a
similar way when shrinking the site, except everything will move onto the next
row as the grid rows get smaller.
*/


/*
auto-fit is used to cut off the width of the grid at the end point of a 
grid item.
*/

/*
auto-fill & auto-fit are good tools to use when we are creating our grid 
columns. Can be used for header buttons, links, etc.
